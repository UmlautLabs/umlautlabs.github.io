          Soumitra Shewale built the Flick! app as

        <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
        <p>
          I want to inform you that whenever you
          use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
          I collect data and information (through third party
          products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
          include information such as your device Internet Protocol
          (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
          configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
          the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
          statistics.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>
          Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
          commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
          to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
          stored on your device's internal memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
          the app may use third party code and libraries that use
          “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
          You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
          and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you

        </p>
        <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
        <p>
          I may employ third-party companies and
          individuals due to the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
          <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
          <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
          <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I want to inform users of this Service
          that these third parties have access to your Personal
          Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
          them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
          disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        <p>
          I value your trust in providing us your
          Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
          acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
          of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
          storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
          guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
        <p>
          This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on

          These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
          I do not knowingly collect personally
          identifiable information from children under 13. In the case

          me with personal information, I immediately
          delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
          and you are aware that your child has provided us with

      <span style="color: white; font-size: large;" class="flow-text">
        Last Revised: 1st May 2020
        <p>
          By downloading or using the app, these terms will
          automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
          that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
          allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
          our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
          extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
          to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
          versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
          database rights and other intellectual property rights related
          to it, still belong to Soumitra Shewale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soumitra Shewale is committed to ensuring that the app is
          as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
          reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
          its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
          charge you for the app or its services without making it very
          clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Flick! app stores and processes personal data that
          you have provided to us, in order to provide my
          Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
          access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
          not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
          removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
          official operating system of your device. It could make your
          phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
          compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
          that the Flick! app won’t work properly or at all.

            The app does use third party services that declare their own

        <p>
          You should be aware that there are certain things that
          Soumitra Shewale will not take responsibility for. Certain
          functions of the app will require the app to have an active
          internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
          by your mobile network provider, but Soumitra Shewale
          cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
          functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
          have any of your data allowance left.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
          should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
          mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
          be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
          the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
          other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
          responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
          charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
          (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
          you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
          using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
          received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the same lines, Soumitra Shewale cannot always take
          responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
          make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
          battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
          Soumitra Shewale cannot accept responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to Soumitra Shewale’s responsibility for your
          use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
          bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
          updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
          to provide information to us so that we can make it available
          to you. Soumitra Shewale accepts no liability for any
          loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
          relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
          currently available on Android – the requirements for
          system(and for any additional systems we
          decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
          and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
          using the app. Soumitra Shewale does not promise that it
          will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
          and/or works with the Android version that you have
          installed on your device. However, you promise to always
          accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
          also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
          it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
          Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
          rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
          (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
          from your device.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
        <p>
          I may update our Terms and Conditions
          from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
          periodically for any changes. I will
          notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
